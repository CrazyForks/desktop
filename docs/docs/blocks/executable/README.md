# :material-play: Executable Blocks

Runbooks support a number of executable blocks. These blocks allow you to run scripts on your local machine, and are the building blocks of most workflows.

While the execution context + state of a script or terminal block is isolated and independent, state is pushed down from the runbook. For instance, using a [directory](directory.md) block, you can set the directory that all subsequent blocks should execute within.

## Serial Execution

Runbooks also support "serial execution". Click the play button in the top right, and runbooks will execute each block in sequence automatically.

!!! warning "Terminal Block Completion"
    There is one small caveat for terminal blocks - they must exit. We cannot automatically determine if a terminal block has completed. You must either click the stop button yourself, or include "exit" somewhere in your input.
