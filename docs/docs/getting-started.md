# Runbook Basics

A runbook is just a document. It can be as simple as a plain-text guide explaining how to restart a service or a fully automated workflow requiring minimal human input.

You can start with plain English and evolve from there. Maybe it’s a simple checklist for junior engineers, or maybe it’s a fully automated disaster recovery plan with embedded scripts and API calls.&#x20;

Runbooks adapt to your workflow, not the other way around.

### Markdown

Our editor supports most Markdown syntax

### Runbook name

The name of the Runbook will always be the first text in the document - this could be a heading, or a paragraph.

### Blocks

To create a new block, type `/`

We support a large number of blocks, built as an abstraction on top of your shell
