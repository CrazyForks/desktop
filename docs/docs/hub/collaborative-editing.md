# Collaborative Editing

The Desktop app supports real-time collaborative editing. Once you've [created a Runbook in an online workspace](sharing-runbooks.md), you can collaborate on it via one of two methods.

## Single-User Collaboration

You can invite individual users to collaborate on your runbook using the Runbook settings, accessible via the cog icon in the top-right corner.

Collaborators can see and modify your Runbook, but they cannot change sharing settings, and they cannot add or remove published tags.

## Team-Based Collaboration

If you collaborate with a number of people regularly, you may want to create an organization on the Hub. Select the "Organizations" tab on your profile page to create an organization.

Once you've created an organization, you can invite users to join. Every user will have the organization listed as an option in their organization selector at the top of the left sidebar in the Desktop app, and any online workspaces that exist within the org will automatically be available to other organization members.
