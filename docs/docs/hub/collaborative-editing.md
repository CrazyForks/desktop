# Collaborative Editing

The Desktop app supports real-time collaborative editing. Once you've [published your Runbook to Atuin Hub](sharing-runbooks.md), you can invite users to collaborate using the same sharing menu.

Collaborators can see and modify your Runbook, but they cannot change sharing settings, and they cannot add or remove published tags. In the future, we'll be improving our collaborative features to include teams and more granular permissions.
