# Sharing Runbooks

Once you're [logged in](getting-started.md) in the Desktop app, you can share any Runbook to Atuin Hub using the share button at the top-right corner of the app. Choose a slug which will become part of the Runbook's URL, and the visibility you want the Runbook to have.

* Public - anyone can see your Runbook
* Unlisted - only people with the Runbook URL can see your Runbook
* Private - only you and people you invite to collaborate can see your Runbook

After you've shared your Runbook to Atuin Hub, it will appear on your profile page. You can update the sharing settings or invite other users to collaborate on your Runbook using the same dropdown.
