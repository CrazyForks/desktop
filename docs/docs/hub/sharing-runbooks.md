# Sharing Runbooks

Once you're [logged in](getting-started.md) in the Desktop app, you can create <strong>online workspaces</strong>. Any Runbook you create will automatically be synced to Atuin Hub with a visibility of "private," meaning only you can access it.

To change the slug (which determines the Runbook's URL) or visibility, click the settings gear in the top-right corner of the app.

* Public - anyone can see your Runbook
* Unlisted - only people with the Runbook URL can see your Runbook
* Private - only you and people you invite to collaborate can see your Runbook

After you've shared your Runbook to Atuin Hub, it will appear on your profile page. You can update the sharing settings or invite other users to collaborate on your Runbook using the same UI (non-org Runbooks only).
