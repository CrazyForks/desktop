# Welcome

Welcome to the Atuin Desktop docs! Here you'll find a guide on basic usage + setup

Please note that we're still in early beta and things are changing fast!

With Desktop, you can create executable and collaborative Runbooks. We're making it easy to go from iterating in your terminal, to building a workflow out of your shell history, to sharing it with your team.

Runbooks provide a real-time, collaborative, block-based editor designed for flexibility. The experience feels similar to Notionâ€”drag, drop, and rearrange content as needed.

Whether you're documenting an incident response, onboarding new engineers, or automating a common workflow, Runbooks make it easy to structure information in a way that works for you.

### Install the CLI

Atuin Desktop works best with the Atuin History CLI

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://setup.atuin.sh | sh
```
